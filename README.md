## Introduction

This is a Megaman-themed game that pits a robot against another.

The idea is to let the user create a robot based on one from the Megaman universe. This robot can fight other robots to gain EXP and Metals (used as currency) to increase its stats and buy equipment and upgrades.

## Technical details
This is a **Node.js** application with **Express.js** as the web application framework.

**React** is used to manage the view, with **Material-UI** providing many useful components.

**Ramda** also provided many indispensable functional methods.

**PostgreSQL** was chosen for the database _(as of now, the database has not been set up)_.

## Major hurdles
- Learning more about **React** within a short time period
